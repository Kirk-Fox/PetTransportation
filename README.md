# PetTransportation
An easy way to bring pets with you.

This plugin was originally created for CweepahCraft, a server on which I spent a lot of time on. It was created by the server's owner, jjm_223, and he has given me permission to update and release it publicly.

### Overview
Simply throw an egg at a tamed pet (or other mob if allowed by the config) to capture it in a spawn egg. Upon spawning it back in another location, it will keep all its relevant mob data.
